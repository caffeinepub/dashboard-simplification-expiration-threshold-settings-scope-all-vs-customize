  "summary": "The diff only updates project_state.json to record the request; it does not replace the Safran logo asset or make any frontend/public asset changes, so REQ-1 is not implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Replace the existing Safran header logo asset with the user-provided image, keeping the public path unchanged: `/assets/generated/safran-logo.dim_220x64.png` (file at `frontend/public/assets/generated/safran-logo.dim_220x64.png`), ensuring it is properly cropped/scaled to 220x64 and transparent if possible, with no code changes needed in AppShell.tsx.",
      "reason": "No asset file changes are shown; only project_state.json was modified. There is no evidence that `frontend/public/assets/generated/safran-logo.dim_220x64.png` was added/updated, so the header logo cannot display the new image as required.",
