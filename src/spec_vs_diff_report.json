  "summary": "The diff does not show implementation of the requested Test Bench i18n localization work or the default-language-to-English behavior. Only `backend/main.mo` (with no visible language-related changes in the provided excerpt) and `project_state.json` were modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Fully localize the entire Test Bench experience by replacing all hardcoded user-facing strings on Test Bench pages/subcomponents with i18n keys, and add complete en-US and fr-FR translations for all used keys.",

      "evidence": [

        "File diff summary shows no frontend files modified.",
        "`backend/main.mo` excerpt includes type definitions (including `UserProfile.languageTag`) but no shown logic changes for defaults or getLanguageTag/getCallerUserProfile behavior."
