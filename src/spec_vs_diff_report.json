  "summary": "BuildRequest is a promotion-only publish of Draft Version 51 to IC mainnet with verified prod env vars, backend health check, frontend publish, and post-publish smoke tests recorded in the existing results template. The diff adds new deployment/smoke-test documentation for V51 and updates the smoke test results template header, but also includes apparent backend/frontend code changes (violating the “no code changes” constraint) and does not provide evidence that the deployment and smoke tests were actually executed and recorded as PASS/FAIL.",
