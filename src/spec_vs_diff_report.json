  "summary": "Implemented RU/ZH/JA/TR entries in `frontend/src/i18n/languages.ts`, but did not implement Add Bench modal localization or add translation dictionaries for the new languages. An unrelated `project_state.json` update was included.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Localize the entire “Add bench” modal flow by replacing all user-facing strings in `frontend/src/pages/Benches/components/AddBenchModal.tsx` with `useI18n().t(...)` calls and adding any missing translation keys (including labels, placeholders, helper/validation text, buttons, loading/uploading text, toast messages).",
      "reason": "The diff shows no modifications to `AddBenchModal.tsx` and no evidence of string replacements or new translation keys being added for the modal.",

      "reason": "`languages.ts` was updated with the new language codes, but `frontend/src/i18n/translations.ts` was not modified/added in the diff, so the required translation dictionaries are missing.",
