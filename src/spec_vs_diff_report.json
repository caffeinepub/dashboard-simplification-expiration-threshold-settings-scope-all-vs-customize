There is no evidence in the diff of an actual production canister upgrade being executed or a smoke test being performed (only checklists/scripts were added).",

      "reason": "The diff contains documentation for deployment, but no evidence of a production canister upgrade being performed (e.g., release/deploy configuration changes, CI/CD changes, or recorded deployment outcome). Also, the backend code was modified, which conflicts with the requirement to deploy without further code changes.",
