  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented (AdminPage header + tab labels now use i18n keys). REQ-3 and REQ-4 show no evidence of implementation (no changes to BenchHistoryList). REQ-2 is partially evidenced but the AdminBenchesPanel diff is truncated and AdminDocumentsPanel still contains some hardcoded UI literals (e.g., version prefix). REQ-5 is partially evidenced (new TranslationKey entries shown) but translation dictionary values for en-US/fr-FR are not visible in the truncated diff.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Localize all remaining user-facing strings in AdminBenchesPanel and AdminDocumentsPanel, including dialog buttons and other UI text.",
      "reason": "AdminBenchesPanel is truncated so confirmation dialog button labels and any remaining strings cannot be verified. Additionally, AdminDocumentsPanel still includes a hardcoded version prefix string (`v`) and separator literals that are user-facing.",

      "reason": "The diff shows many new `TranslationKey` union entries, but the file is truncated and does not show the actual en-US and fr-FR dictionary values for the new keys, so completeness cannot be verified from the provided diff.",
