  "summary": "The diff implements a centralized React Query dashboard export query (with a stable queryKey), updates DashboardPage and BenchDocumentsEditor to consume it, and indicates that document/bench-document mutations now invalidate the dashboard export query for instant refresh. There are also unrelated changes in BenchDetailPage (component duplicate detection / other refactoring) not requested by the BuildRequest.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added client-side duplicate detection logic when saving bench components (blocking save and showing an error toast).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is specifically about dashboard documents refreshing after bench-document changes; it does not request new validation rules or UX changes for bench components saving.",

      "description": "Bench detail page refactor/behavior changes unrelated to document refresh (e.g., hooks/import changes such as using useGetComponents instead of another hook, additional localized UI behavior).",
      "reason": "These changes are not part of REQ-1..REQ-4 and go beyond fixing the dashboard documents refresh behavior.",
